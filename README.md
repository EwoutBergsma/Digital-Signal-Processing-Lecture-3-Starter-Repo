# Exercises

1. Using Python download a sound file and load it into Python (see yesterdayâ€™s exercise 5). Plot the data in the time domain.

1. Using this documentation: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/fft.html find out how to convert the sound file into the frequency domain, implement this on your data. Plot it in the frequency domain.

1. What can you learn from this plot? Analyze it.

1. Repeat the exercise with a different sound, compare the two different frequency domain plots.
